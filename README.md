## Project Description 

 A telecom company offers two type of phone plan. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget.
 The datasets of the prepaid plans are given in the following features:
 plans,  
 calls,
 internet, and 
 users
 The main task on this analysis is to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. Then use the given data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. Finally the conclusion will be made by analyzing clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.
