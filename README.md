# Statistical Analysis of Two Telecom Plans
## Overview
I did this project during the completion of Praticum Data Analytic Bootcamp Program. A Prepaid Telecom company plans to increase revenue from two of the prepaid plans. To accomplish this goal I did the statistical analysis of two plans.

## Prerequisite
Datasets from two prepaid plans  
Python download and necessary libraries

## Project Description 
 A telecom company offers two types of phone plan. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget.  
 The datasets of the prepaid plans are given in the following features:  
 plans,   
 calls,  
 internet(mb used), and   
 users.  
  I checked and cleaned the given datasets. Then I did necessary conversion of some units such as time and internet digital information.  
  The main task on this analysis is to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection.  
 Then I used the given data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018.  
I analyzed the two plans on the basis of plan's features such as call duration, number of messages sent, internet data(mb used) used on factor such as user's age, time of a year, and geographical location.   
I did hypothesis testing on mean revenue collection from the two plans.    
Then the second hypothesis testing is to check revenue collection of New York and outside of New York city.  
Finally, I made the conclusion by analyzing clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.
